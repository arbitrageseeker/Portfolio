# Portfolio

Project for retrieving and processing transactions and daily prices data for personal portfolio holdings.
Processed data is used later in analysis and visualisations. 

Potential development areas in the future:
  - retrieve transactions data from banks/financial institutions through API
    - requires banks to have API for personal use (PSD2?)
  - retrieve capital gain and dividend taxes from the tax authority (Verohallinto) through API
    - requires the tax authoirty to have API for personal use (not currently)
    - otherwise, to use pdftools
